# HMM

#### How to run
- Install node
- Clone this repository
- Viterbi: run `npm run start:viterbi`
- Posterior Decoding: run `npm run start:posterior-decoding`

#### This is a small project that computes:
- The most likely annotations of a sequence given an HMM (Viterbi algorithm).
- The posterior-decoding (using the Forward and Backward algorithms).


That project handled as an homework assignment for the course: "Algorithms in Computational Biology".
